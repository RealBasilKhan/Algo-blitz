# next-p5-template

A gallery website for making p5.js sketches built with Next.js. 

Note that unlike pure p5.js where you can access draw function globally, 
you have to use variable `p` to draw. (E.g., `p.rect(...)`, `p.line(...)`, etc.)

### How to run

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn dev`
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000`

### How to make new sketch

1. `yarn new-sketch`, this will create a new js file for your sketch, e.g., `d1.js`
2. Code!

### Navigation

- Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view all sketches. 
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/s/1` to view each sketch.
